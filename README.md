# Designing Micro Frontend with Web Components

Micro frontend extends the concepts of micro services to the frontend world. The term “Micro Frontends” has been a buzzword for breaking up growing front-end code into easy-to-maintain parts. Microfrontend is an architectural approach where frontend is divided into its multiple functions or parts. These parts are implemented and deployed by independent teams. This increases the testability, reusability and offers the possibility to select different technologies for each micro frontend.
